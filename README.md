# Cyber-Threat-Intelligence
Collection of data and information on cyber threats and cyber threat intelligence in a wider sense.

The intention of this repository is to collect and store information on cyber threats and cyber threat intelligence. One reason for establishing this repository was that a lot of data, information and intelligence is widely scattered throughout the Internet. Furthermore, older repots get deleated or disappear because vendors get bought or get out of business.
