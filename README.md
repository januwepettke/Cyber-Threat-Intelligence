# Cyber-Threat-Intelligence
Collection of data and information on cyber threats and cyber threat intelligence in a wider sense.

The intention of this repository is to collect and store information on cyber threats and cyber threat intelligence. One reason for establishing this repository was that a lot of data, information and intelligence is widely scattered throughout the Internet. Furthermore, older repots get deleated or disappear because vendors get bought or get out of business. 

When using the repository users need to understand that the reports contained are not subject to any updates. This means that newer research and analysis might provide additional information or deviating assessments. Therefore, and independent research is highly advisable.
